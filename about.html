    <h1>What is Global Warming?</h1>
    <p>Global Warming is a serious enduring issue up to today. Global warming is the long term heating of the Earth's surface due to the increasing concentration levels of Carbon Dioxide and other greenhouse gases that were trapped in the Earth's atmosphere. Global warming presents several changes to the climate and the environment we know and love. Sea levels are rising, temperatures are rising, and certain areas are more prone to natural disasters, like droughts or flooding. </p>
