   <p>You may be wondering "is there anything I can do to help conserve the environment". Well you can! Some of things you can do to protect our environment and the wildlife surrounding it are: </p>
   <ul class="content-list">
     <li>Conserve Water</li>
     <p>This means to use less water if possible, or in other words, don't waste water, which would protect the amount of water in our oceans.</p>
     <li>Reduce Reuse Recycle (triple r)</li>
     <p>We may have heard this term in many places, such as schools or in our communities. This means to simply recycle objects and sort them out appropriately, rather than literring. </p>
     <li>Walk,bike,or use MTA</li>
     <p>By walking or biking, we are lessening the amount of fuels and gases that are escaping into the air through driving.</p>
     <li>Save Energy at Home</li>
     <p>To save energy at home, try to turn off the lights when they are not needed!</p>
     <li>Volunteer</li>
     <p>Volunteering in your local park can go a long way! Being a volunteer to help clean up and pick up trash can help to ensure that the environment is getting cleaned and even inspire others to join the cause!</p>
