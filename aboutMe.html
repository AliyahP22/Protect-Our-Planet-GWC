    <h1>Who am I?</h1>

    <p>Hi there! My name is Aliyah!! I am a rising senior with a passion for computer science! I especially have a liking for coding! I love to code websites and webpages using HTML, CSS, and python and I look forward to expanding my knowledge in coding. I also like graphic designing. I created this project during the Summer Pathways Program at Girls who Code.I was motivated to create this website because global warming and pollution of our environment is becoming a serious issue, endangering the atmosphere and animal species. As a person who loves plants and animals, I was inspired to encourage change and show that we all can make a difference and help out in protecting the environment.  </p>
